    pt is a tuple (lat, long)

    - a tuple (lats, longs) where lats is an iterable of floats (and longs also)
    - a (2 * N) numpy array where N is the length of the trajectory

    Adapted from https://gist.github.com/jeromer/2005586 (public domain) for
    use with numpy arrays.

    The formula used is the following:
        θ = arctan2(sin(Δlong).cos(lat2),
                  cos(lat1).sin(lat2) - sin(lat1).cos(lat2).cos(Δlong))

    Parameters
    ----------
    pt1, pt2: positions (latitude/longitude in °) of first/second point

    Each pt in (pt1, pt2) can be:
    - a tuple (lat, long) where lat/long are floats or iterables of floats
      (e.g. tuples, lists, arrays)
    - a (2 * N) numpy array where 2 corresponds to (lat, long) and N the number
      of successive points to calculate.
    - any structure equivalent to the structures above in terms of unpacking.

    Output
    ------
    Compass bearing in decimal degrees (°)

    """Smooth 1-d data with a window of requested size and type.

    Based on Scipy cookbook:
    https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/SignalSmooth.html

    This method is based on the convolution of a scaled window with the signal.
    The signal is prepared by introducing reflected copies of the signal
    (with the window size) in both ends so that transient parts are minimized
    in the begining and end part of the output signal.

    INPUT
    -----
    - `x`: the input signal
    - `n`: the dimension of the smoothing window; should be an odd integer
    - `window`: the type of window ('flat', 'hanning', 'hamming', 'bartlett',
      'blackman'); flat window will produce a moving average smoothing.

    OUTPUT
    ------
    - Smoothed signal of same length as input signal

    EXAMPLE
    -------
    x = np.linspace(0, 7 * np.pi, 100)
    y = np.sin(x - 1) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(n)
